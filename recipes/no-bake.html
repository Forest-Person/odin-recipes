        <h2> Description of the dish</h2>
        <p>Tasty no-bake cookies made with oatmeal, peanut butter and cocoa. <br>
            Start timing when mixture reaches a full rolling boil; this is the trick to successful cookies. <br>
            If you boil too long the cookies will be dry and crumbly. <br>
            If you don't boil long enough, the cookies won't form properly.<br> </p>
